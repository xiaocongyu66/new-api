/**
 * Decouples "router state changed" from "loading bar visibility".
 *
 * Without this, calling `continuousStart()` on every status flip produces
 * two bad behaviors:
 *  - On cached routes the bar flashes for a single frame
 *    (status goes pending → idle within the same paint).
 *  - On real loads the bar grows to 95% over 1 second using a fixed
 *    interval, regardless of how long the actual load takes.
 *
 * The scheduler:
 *  - delays showing the bar by `showDelayMs` so instant transitions stay
 *    bar-less;
 *  - jumps to a static `initialProgress` (no creep) once shown;
 *  - calls `complete()` exactly when the load actually resolves (caller
 *    drives the transitions, not a fixed timer).
 *
 * ponytail: global setTimeout handle; safe across rapid notifyPending /
 * notifyIdle cycles because the timer is cancelled and the visible flag
 * is checked. If the page becomes a SPA inside a Web Worker we would
 * move this off the main thread, but that is overkill for a top bar.
