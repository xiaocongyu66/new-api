// IsNormalWSClose reports whether err is the peer closing a websocket cleanly:
// a close frame carrying 1000 (normal closure) or 1001 (going away). The relay
// treats those as an ordinary end of conversation and everything else as a
// failure worth reporting.
//
// It has to recognise both libraries' close errors, and that is not redundant.
// The realtime relay holds two connections whose concrete types come from
// different modules: the client side is the server-side upgrade (gorilla under
// the gin adapter, gofiber/contrib -- i.e. fasthttp/websocket -- under the fiber
// one), while the target side is always a gorilla client dial. fasthttp's
// websocket package is a gorilla fork, so the two *CloseError types are
// structurally identical but distinct Go types, and each library's own
// IsCloseError type-asserts only its own: gorilla.IsCloseError returns false for
// a fasthttp CloseError and vice versa.
//
// That failure is silent and it is the reason this exists. Using one library's
// check for both connections would classify every clean disconnect on the other
// as an error, so an ordinary browser closing a realtime session would be logged
// and reported as a relay failure on every request.
