// TestRenderSSEMatchesCustomEventFraming is the equivalence proof for moving
// RenderSSE off c.ResponseWriter() and onto contract.ResponseStream.
//
// It renders every payload shape the relay emits through both paths: the
// framing primitive on its own (CustomEvent.RenderTo onto a plain buffer) and
// the migrated one through the contract, then compares the bytes and the
// headers. The shapes matter individually because CustomEvent is not a uniform
// framer: it escapes CR, and appends the blank-line terminator only when the
// payload starts with "data", so `event:` prefixes and partial frames pass
// through unterminated. Routing these through EventStream.WriteEvent instead
// would terminate and re-prefix all of them, which is why RenderSSE stayed on
// this path.
//
// The header half is asserted against the literal SSE values the deleted
// CustomEvent.WriteContentType wrote ("text/event-stream", and "no-cache" when
// nothing set Cache-Control); its conditional branch is pinned separately by
// TestRenderSSEPreservesAnExistingCacheControl below.

// unflushableStream is a contract.ResponseStream that reports the flush
// capability as absent while its Flush silently succeeds, standing in for the
// dangerous transport: one that accepts every flush and buffers the response to
// completion anyway (a wrapping middleware that materialises the body, or a
// writer with no flusher underneath).
//
// Faking at the contract is a correction, not a workaround for fiber. The gin
// fixture this replaces built an http.ResponseWriter with no Flush method, which
// asserted through a layer the code under test never consults: FlushWriter and
// IOCopyBytesGracefully branch on contract CanFlush, never on an
// http.ResponseWriter type assertion. That fixture only worked because
// ginadapter happened to answer CanFlush by walking the writer's Unwrap chain.
// Under fasthttp there is no such writer to build at all — the adapter reports
// CanFlush as a constant true because every mode it constructs can push (a chain
// owns the pipe, a direct response writes through fiber, a synthetic one records
// the flush on its recorder) — so the contract is both the honest and the only
// available interception point. That a real adapter keeps Flush and CanFlush in
// agreement is pinned separately, by the conformance suite's
// CanFlushAgreesWithFlushAndHasNoSideEffect.
