// which the snapshot test cannot see: TestRegisteredRoutesMatchSnapshot sorts
// the registered paths and compares them as a set, so a route that is
// registered but can never be matched still satisfies it.
//
// fiber scans its route stack in registration order and serves the first match
// (see fiberadapter/router.go). gin sorted its tree by specificity, so a
// literal segment beat a parameter no matter which was registered first; fiber
// has no such rule. Any literal path registered after an overlapping
// parameterised one is therefore dead code that answers with the other
// handler's response — GET /api/channel/health used to reach GetChannel and
// report `strconv.Atoi: parsing "health"` instead of the health payload.
//
// The check runs over every registered group rather than just the channel
// routes, because the hazard is a property of the adapter and applies wherever
// a group mixes literals with parameters.
