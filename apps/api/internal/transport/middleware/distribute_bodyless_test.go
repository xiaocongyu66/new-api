// The relay group mounts Distribute() in front of every /v1 route, including the
// bodyless ones: GET /v1/files, GET /v1/fine-tunes, DELETE /v1/files/:id and --
// most importantly -- the GET /v1/realtime WebSocket upgrade. Distribute calls
// getModelRequest, which for any path that is not audio or multipart falls
// through to getModelFromRequest and decodes the request body looking for a
// model name.
//
// A bodyless request carries zero bytes. UnmarshalBodyReusable coerces an absent
// Content-Type to application/json and gjson rejects zero bytes outright, so an
// empty body used to fail with "unexpected end of JSON input" and Distribute
// turned that into a 400 before the request reached its handler.
//
// Reading a model out of an absent body is not an error; it simply yields no
// model. What each route does next is its own business, and the two outcomes
// differ, so the assertions split:
//
//   - /v1/realtime carries its model in the query string, so it must reach its
//     handler. This is the severe half: that route is the WebSocket upgrade, and
//     a 400 there breaks realtime end to end.
//   - The RelayNotImplemented routes carry no model anywhere, so they are still
//     rejected for a missing model name -- exactly as they were before the
//     content-type coercion landed. They must fail on THAT, never on a body
//     parse.
//
// These cases drive real requests through a real engine with the real Distribute
// middleware, because that is the only place the bug was visible: every unit test
// of the body helper hands it a body, and the route snapshot asserts only that a
// route is registered, not that it can be reached.

// The realtime upgrade carries its model in the query string, so getModelRequest
// must resolve it and report no error. It is asserted through a probe handler
// rather than end to end because the next step in Distribute is
// catalog.SelectChannel, which needs a channel cache and a database that a
// middleware test has no business standing up. What regressed here was the body
// read, and this is where the body read is observable: before the fix this route
// never got past getModelRequest.
