// the dispatcher answers it on.
//
// The handshake cannot happen on the chain's goroutine. fasthttp reads
// RequestCtx.hijackHandler only after the request handler returned (server.go
// reads it once the handler is off the stack), so the hijack has to be
// registered while the fiber handler is still running -- which is the
// dispatcher, parked in run's select. The chain therefore asks, and the
// dispatcher performs.

// The inversion fiber's websocket support normally imposes -- the framework owns

// business code. The chain parks, the dispatcher registers the hijack while it
// is still on fiber's stack, and the hijack goroutine hands the connection back
// to the parked chain and then waits for it. So the caller keeps writing
// straight-line code with its own defers, exactly as it did under gin.
//
// The response belongs to the upgrader from here on: on success fasthttp writes
// the 101 and the upgrade headers it staged, and on failure the upgrader has
// already written its own HTTP error. Neither may be overwritten by this
// adapter's commit, so both outcomes mark the response as no longer ours.
