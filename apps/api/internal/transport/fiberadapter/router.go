// Package fiberadapter implements the transport contract on fiber/fasthttp.
//
// Two structural differences from the Gin adapter are load-bearing and deliberate.
//
// First, contract middleware never enters fiber's own handler stack. Dispatch
// commits the response and returns while the contract chain may still be
// running on another goroutine (that is what lets fasthttp drain a body stream
// under real backpressure), and fiber recycles its *fiber.Ctx into a pool as
// soon as the handler returns. A contract middleware mounted through app.Use
// would therefore resume after Next against a Ctx that already belongs to a
// different request. So the chain is flattened the way gin flattens
// RouterGroup.combineHandlers: routes accumulates the pending handlers, and
// every concrete route becomes exactly one fiber handler holding the whole
// chain. Registration order is preserved by construction, which is what
// contract.Routes requires anyway.
//
// Second, and following from the first: CORS, access logging and panic recovery
// are contract handlers in that flattened chain rather than engine-level
// middleware. Recovery has no alternative -- a recover() in a fiber handler
// cannot catch a panic raised on Dispatch's goroutine, so mounting it there
// would turn a handler panic into a process crash. Only genuinely fiber-native
// layers (compression, the asset probe, the fallback route) use app.Use.
